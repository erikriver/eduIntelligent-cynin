MaildropHost change log
=======================

1.22 (2008-08-11)
-----------------

- Bug: MaildropHost.getLog and the "Maildrop Log" ZMI tab: To avoid
  problems with addresses enclosed by <> the log contents are now
  HTML-quoted for display. The maximum display size is limited to
  about 50 KB to prevent browsers from hanging.
  (http://www.dataflake.org/tracker/issue_00589 by Giovanni Toffoli)

- Configuration parsing: Replace the import-based configuration
  parsing with simpler string parsing. Patch by Rob Miller. See
  INSTALL.tx for additional upgrade notes.

- MaildropHost: Make the 'id' argument to the MaildropHost
  __init__ method optional to ease GenericSetup compatibility.

1.21 (2007-12-26)
-----------------

- Bug: MaildropHost.Email: Once the temporary file and lock file are
  written to disk, save some memory be pruning the email object,
  following a suggestion from Maik Jablonski.
  (http://www.dataflake.org/tracker/issue_00587)

- Bug: maildrop.py: make sure the PID-file is removed upon exit or
  termination, suggested by Johnny Souza.

- Bug: maildrop.py: prevent an error from gmail by issuing EHLO during 
  the test connection, filed by Johnny Souza.
  (http://www.dataflake.org/tracker/issue_00578)

- Bug: maildrop.py: Test for and catch a broken connection when ending the
  SMTP conversation with the mail server, found by Junyong Pan.
  (http://www.dataflake.org/tracker/issue_00568)

- Bug: maildropctl: Improve behavior when maildropctl is run and finds
  an existing PID file. Thanks go to Johnny Souza.
  (http://www.dataflake.org/tracker/issue_00583)

- Feature: maildrop.py: Add a setting that prevents detaching from the 
  controlling terminal while running without extra debug output, this
  allows running the maildrop process under Daemontools. Patch 
  provided by Michael Dunstan.

1.20 (2007-06-13)
-----------------

- Feature: MaildropHost: Added a tab in the ZMI to view the maildrop daemon
  log file contents.
  (http://www.dataflake.org/tracker/issue_00565)

- Bug: maildrop.py: Since Windows does not support detaching from the
  controlling terminal the way it is done in maildrop.py, we now 
  ignore any debug mode setting and force it into debug mode when
  run on Windows so it does not detach. Thanks to Philip Kilner for 
  the inspiration.

- Dropped compatibility with Zope versions < 2.8

- Added a DEPENDENCIES.txt document to show package/version 
  dependencies
