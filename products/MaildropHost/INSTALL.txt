Installing the MaildropHost Product
-----------------------------------

You will need Zope version 2.8.0 or higher!

The maildrop daemon is not supported under Windows.

First, you will need to unzip and untar the compressed surce 
file into a place where Zope can find it, namely the 
"Products" directory::

  $ cp MaildropHost-xyz.tgz <zope_root>/lib/python/Products
  $ cd <zope_root>/lib/python/Products
  $ tar zxvf MaildropHost-xyz.tgz
  <watch files being decompressed>

Do not forget to restart Zope afterwards.

You will find a file named "config.py" in the toplevel MaildropHost
folder. This file contains all site-specific settings and you must
edit it to suit your needs. IMPORTANT: Since this file is also
sourced by a few shell scripts you must not put any whitespace
around equal (=) signs!

Startup scripts for the standalone maildrop daemon, which processes
mail items generated by the MaildropHost Zope product, can be found
inside the <MaildropHost>/maildrop/bin-folder. What these scripts
do and how to use them is described in a separate README inside that
folder.

See README.txt for any other dependencies and requirements.


Upgrade notes
-------------

- 1.21 to 1.22: The configuration file parsing mechanism changed, it's no
  longer a Python module. The code will now look for a file named `config`
  instead of `config.py`, the file contents have not changed, though.
